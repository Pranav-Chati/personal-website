## Learnings
During this project, the coolest thing I kind of learned was how to better use the terminal. Specifically when I was initially trying to figure out the icons to use, I was initially playing around with FontAwesome; however, I didn't entirely like their fonts. I used `npm list` to figure out which dependencies that I currently have, and which ones I didn't need. I uninstalled the FontAwesome dependecies. It was cool to learn that such things exist though.
